# CNN Implementation for Image Classification

## Objective

The objective of this experiment is to implement Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification using the Cats vs. Dogs dataset and the CIFAR-10 dataset. The experiment includes exploring different configurations by varying:

- **Activation Functions**: ReLU, Tanh, and Leaky ReLU
- **Weight Initialization Techniques**: Xavier Initialization, Kaiming Initialization, and Random Initialization
- **Optimizers**: SGD, Adam, and RMSprop

Additionally, we compare the performance of our best CNN models with a pretrained ResNet-18 model.

## Steps to Complete the Task

### 1. CNN Implementation

- Define and experiment with different CNN architectures:
  - Vary the number of convolutional layers and filter sizes.
  - Include pooling layers and fully connected layers.
  - Use dropout and batch normalization for regularization and stability.
- Train the CNN models using different combinations of activation functions, weight initializations, and optimizers.
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy and loss metrics.

### 2. Training and Evaluation

- Train the CNN models on the Cats vs. Dogs and CIFAR-10 datasets.
- Save the best-performing model for each dataset and the model weights.

### 3. Transfer Learning with ResNet-18

- Fine-tune a pretrained ResNet-18 model on both datasets.
- Compare the performance of ResNet-18 with the best-performing CNN models.

## Results

- The models are evaluated based on accuracy and loss.
- The best-performing models are saved.
